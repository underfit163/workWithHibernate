# workWithHibernate
In the process of writing test tasks, get acquainted with Hibernate.

**Task 1.**
Using Hibernate, create and fill in the tables again. To do this, you will need to describe three auxiliary classes and a file hibernate.cfg.xml. Mapping an object to a table is implemented using annotations.

**Task 2.**
Demonstrate data output, as well as deleting and editing data in any of the tables.
